<p>Firstly, we have to install grunt plugin to help running this demo:</p>
<p>1. Open command line</p>
<p>2. Go to the directory: 'kata-tdd-1-BINH-NGUYEN-VAN'</p>
<p>3. Type the command: npm install</p>
<p>4. Run the command: grunt serve</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
Q1: In the requirement, I see "2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers". I think this is too general. It's up to a lot of thing. Could you give an advice about this?

Q2: Support different delimiters: This means we support all delimiters in the article "http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1" or we have to support all delimiters that you think it could be a delimiter?
